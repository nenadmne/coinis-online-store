# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Install project dependencies using npm:
"npm install"


2. Start the development server:
"npm run dev"

3. Login Simulation
For login simulation, you can use the following credentials:
**Admin Account:**
- Username: "admin"
- Password: [Your chosen password]

**User Account:**
- Username: "user"
- Password: [Your chosen password]

4. Responsive design Note
When inspecting responsive design in developer tools, it's important to note that after entering the final dimensions, the page needs to be refreshed. Changes cannot be applied dynamically within the developer tools. Responsive design includes conditions based on window.innerWidth.
